# telegram-pybot
A Telegram Bot based on plugins using tg (currently a fork). 

Everything is being written for Python 3.4 currently. Everything works in a virtualenv installed and sourced in the launch script.

    git clone https://github.com/datamachine/telegram-pybot --recursive
    cd telegram-pybot
    ./launch.sh install
    ./launch.sh

There are not a ton of useful plugins by default, but you can run ``` !pkg update ``` and then ``` !pkg list_all ``` to see what plugins are available to install.

{"name":"Telex","tagline":"Plugin-based Python Telegram Bot","body":"# About\r\n\r\nTelex is a telegram bot based on plugins. \r\n\r\nThis bot uses tg and tgl C libraries for its bindings, and we have been contributing our python bindings as we work through it.\r\n\r\nEverything is being written for Python 3.4 currently. Everything works in a virtualenv installed and sourced in the launch script.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are not a ton of useful plugins by default, but you can run ``` !pkg update ``` and then ``` !pkg list all ``` to see what plugins are available to install.\r\n\r\nSome plugins require admin permissions. You can set an admin in permissions.conf using the following format\r\n\r\n```\r\n[groups]\r\n  admins = <userid#>,<userid#>,<userid#>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can get your user id number by sending the following query to the bot\r\n\r\n```\r\n!tginfo id\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nSteps:\r\n1: Clone git repository.\r\n2: Install dependencies\r\n3: Install telex\r\n4: Setup tg\r\n5: Run telex\r\n\r\n#### Cloning the repository\r\n\r\n    git clone --recursive https://github.com/datamachine/telex.git && cd telex\r\n\r\n#### Installing dependencies\r\n\r\n##### Linux and BSDs\r\n\r\nInstall libs: readline, openssl and (if you want to use config) libconfig, liblua, python3-dev, python-virtualenv and libjansson.\r\n\r\nNote: Installation was tested only on Ubuntu and Debian\r\n\r\n###### On Ubuntu/Debian use: \r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev libconfig-dev libssl-dev lua5.2 liblua5.2-dev libevent-dev libjansson-dev python3-dev python-virtualenv make \r\n\r\n###### On gentoo:\r\n\r\n    sudo emerge -av sys-libs/readline dev-libs/libconfig dev-libs/openssl dev-lang/lua dev-libs/libevent dev-libs/jansson dev-lang/python-3 dev-python/virtualenv \r\n\r\n###### On Fedora:\r\n\r\n    sudo yum install lua-devel openssl-devel libconfig-devel readline-devel libevent-devel libjansson-devel python3-devel python-virtualenv \r\n\r\n###### On FreeBSD:\r\n\r\n    pkg install libconfig libexecinfo lua52 python3 devel/py-virtualenv\r\n\r\n#### Installing telex\r\nTo install the bot, run the following in telex directory.\r\n\r\n    ./launch.sh install\r\n\r\n#### Setting up Telegram cli (verifying phone number)\r\nDo the following.\r\n\r\n    cd tg\r\n    bin/telegram-cli -k tg-server.pub\r\n\r\nIt will ask for your phone number and confirmation code.\r\nAfter successful verificaion of phone number, press Ctrl+C to stop telegram-cli.\r\n\r\n#### Running telex\r\n\r\nTo start the bot, run the following in telex directory.\r\n\r\n    ./launch\r\n\r\n### Running bot as a service\r\nIf you have [upstart](http://upstart.ubuntu.com/), you can run the bot as a service by following the below procedure.\r\n\r\nTo check if you have upstart, just run \r\n\r\n    sudo start\r\n\r\nIf output is something like this, then you have upstart.\r\n\r\n    start: missing job name\r\n    Try `start --help' for more information.\r\nEdit the config file.\r\n\r\n    sed -i \"s/yourusername/$(whoami)/g\" temp/telex.conf\r\n    sed -i \"s_telegrambotpath_$(pwd)_g\" temp/telex.conf\r\n    sudo cp temp/telex.conf /etc/init/\r\n    sudo start telex # To start it\r\n    sudo stop telex # To stop it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\nWhile already very capable, this bot is still in relatively early development. Some plugin names, or plugin API calls may be modifed. However, we are starting to settle on our stable APIs.\r\n\r\nWith that said, we do strive to have the bot continue to function seemlessly when pulling the latest HEAD\r\n\r\n# Contact\r\n\r\nThe primary developers are Vince (@Surye) and Phillip (@Tyrannosaurus) and can be contacted directly through telegram.\r\n\r\nYou can also join our telegram group using the link: https://telegram.me/joinchat/05c5c2f60112fa104d1c0c563b2fd34a\r\n\r\nBug reports and issues can be reported at: https://github.com/datamachine/telex/issues\r\n\r\n# Known Issues\r\n\r\n## Not recieving telegram verification text on initial launch\r\n\r\nTry running tg directly.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ tg/bin/telegram-cli -k tg-server.pub\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce you verify the client, you can stop it and run the launch.sh script again.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
